# Bear With Me

A simple mod that adds new bear species to Minecraft!

## Features
**Black Bear**

  Found in forested areas.

**Grizzly Bear**

  Lives in hills and plains.

**Panda Bear**

  Elusive jungle dweller.

**Loot**

  Bears drop their respective hides, which can be crafted into leather.

**Config**

  Options to change the spawn weight of each species. Keep in mind that species that spawn in densely forested areas
  have less area to spawn on than those that spawn in open areas.  This will affect spawn numbers, even if spawn 
  weights are the same for all species.
